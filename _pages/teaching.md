<span style ="font-size:.9em;">*Teaching, for me, is way more than just standing in front of a class and delivering a lecture, it is about making learning fun. I aim to create a classroom vibe where students feel comfortable enough to ask questions, share ideas, and learn alongside their classmates. I love throwing in real-world examples because let’s face it, theory is great, but seeing how it works in the wild and finding its real-life use is way cooler. I’m all about hands-on learning; simulations, and activities that make you go, “Oh, so that’s how it works!” My ultimate goal is to spark curiosity, to get those critical thinking gears turning, and make economics something you actually look forward to instead of memorizing just another "long-run cost curve". *</span>
